A database is a structured collection of data stored/archived electronically. It can contains any kind of data, including words, numbers, images and video.
There are two types of databeses: non-relational and relational databases.
A non-relational database is a database which doesn't use tables formed by rows and columns.
A relational database organizes data in rows and columns, and together they make a table. A relational database can enstablish links (relation) between data merging the tables.
