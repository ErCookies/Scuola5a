###### **Machine Language and Programming Basics**

1. What is machine language (or machine code) composed of, and how does a computer interpret this sequence?
2. Why is it "almost impossible" for humans to program directly using machine language?
3. What is an algorithm, and what is its role for programmers before writing instructions in a programming language?

###### **Low-Level and High-Level Languages**

1. What is the primary function of Low-Level Languages (LLL) in relation to the computer?
2. What are the two examples of machine-dependent, low-level languages mentioned in the text?
3. What characteristic of programs written in a low-level language allows them to be directly executable on the computer hardware?
4. How does the syntax of High-Level Languages (HLL) differ from low-level languages, and what benefit does this provide to the programmer?
5. What key advantage does a high-level language offer regarding its machine-dependency?

###### **Translation Programs**

1. What is the main function of translation programs in the context of programming languages?
2. Describe the two-step process a compiler uses to convert a program into an executable file, mentioning the two types of programs involved.
3. How does an interpreter process the source code differently from a compiler?
4. What is the specific role of an assembler?
5. Which translation program deals specifically with the translation of assembly language?
6. Which translation program creates an object file as an intermediate step?
7. Which programming language, if any, does not require a translation program to be directly executable on the computer hardware?





###### **ALGORITHM**

1. Who was Mohammed Ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, and what significant contribution did he make that relates to the word "algorithm"?
2. The text defines an algorithm as a set of "precise, i.e. unambiguous, rules." Why is the characteristic of being unambiguous vital for solving a problem?
3. What is the definition of the algorithm characteristic known as correctness?
4. Explain why the analysis of algorithms often resembles "other fields of mathematics" in its approach to study.
5. The text states that algorithms must be defined rigorously. What specifically must this rigorous definition apply to?
6. Which two common types of computer applications mentioned in the text involve modifying the state or security of data (making it smaller or protected)?
7. What specific detail does an algorithm provide in a computer program regarding the steps to be performed?
8. The characteristic of determinism states that intermediate results are determined only by inputs and the results of the previous step. What does this highlight about the prolcess of an algorithm?
9. Name the two distinct ways mentioned in the text that algorithms can be expressed or shown.
10. Which two applications listed in the text are primarily used for organizing and accessing information stored in files or text?





###### **COMPUTER LANGUAGES vs NATURAL LANGUAGES** 

1. What is the fundamental difference in purpose between natural languages and programming languages, according to the text?
2. Explain the difference between computer languages and natural languages regarding ambiguity (being context-free vs. context-dependent).
3. Why do programming languages require a high degree of precision and expertise from the programmer?
4. What characteristic of computer language commands ensures that the meaning is understood by all computers?
5. In what way are high-level languages similar to natural languages in terms of their structure?
6. How does the ability of a computer to "read between the lines" affect the way minor errors are handled in programming languages compared to natural languages?
7. Is the syntax of programming languages based on the grammar of natural languages? Explain briefly based on the text.
8. Regarding formality, how do natural languages differ from programming languages?
9. What specific examples are provided to illustrate the creative nature of natural languages?
10. Name three components (rules/elements) that are part of natural languages but are not explicitly listed as components of computer languages (though some may overlap).
