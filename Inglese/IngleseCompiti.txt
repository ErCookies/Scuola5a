Bicycles are generally considered to be safer and easier to control. (10) ………, the fact is that

not make allowances for them.
(12) ………, those who are old enough to ride motorbikes naturally prefer them, but they should

requires more experience of traffic than before. On balance, the change has been for the worse. The only
safe solution would be to have more special lanes for cyclists.
